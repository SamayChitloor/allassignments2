     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Any food that has no or negligible nutritional value can be considered as junk foods. Most of the fast foods, including candy, bakery products, burgers and sausages, salty and oily snacks or soft drinks can be categorized as junk food. They have a high calorie content, salts and fats. The more we consume these, the less is the intake of essential nutrients and vitamins in the body.</p>

            Eating a moderate and varied diet can help with weight loss, weight control and help you stay healthy. Moderation, however, is a subjective term. Still, guidelines can help you take in a reasonable amount of food. You just need to pay attention to them. I find it very helpful to use measuring cups for a few days or a week to help understand exactly what 1 cup or 1 tablespoon looks like. Also, paying attention to your how hungry you are before and after eating a small amount of food can help you gauge how much you should be eating or if you tend to overeat. Keeping a food dairy is an old dietitian trick and tends to work better than you can imagine.
